        <p>The title is an understatement, and so is the film. Roman Polanski's "The Pianist" tells the story of a
            Polish Jew, a classical musician, who survived the Holocaust through stoicism and good luck. This is not a
            thriller, and avoids any temptation to crank up suspense or sentiment; it is the pianist's witness to what
            he saw and what happened to him. That he survived was not a victory when all whom he loved died; Polanski,
            in talking about his own experiences, has said that the death of his mother in the gas chambers remains so
            hurtful that only his own death will bring closure.
